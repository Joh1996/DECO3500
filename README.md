The primary focus of the prototype was to address the issue of the spread of false information (also referred to as ‘fake news’) on social media by providing a platform for users to fact check and be alerted of potentially misleading articles. The initial plan was to create a web browser plug-in or a web application that allowed news consumers to only be notified of misleading content and/or flagged news articles. However, the initial plan required almost no user interaction, did not propose any solution to preventing the spread of false information, and set no standards for objective, high-quality journalism.

Upon research and user evaluations, the problem space and the domain remained far too ambiguous and large to be simply resolved via targeting social media platforms such as Facebook or Twitter. It was also far too unrealistic to force our system onto the consumers directly, when the problem exists within the content creators.  To clarify, our research and evaluation suggest that users with preconceived biases are unlikely to shift their political views with a simple notification or an alert. In addition, users without preconceived biases will not be incentivized to fact check given the lack of standards for journalism. For example, current popular news and media outlets have no set standards for high quality journalism while users also lacking a template to compare their expectations with. From the results of our user evaluation and research, we suggest that average news consumers are almost forced to trust the subjectivity that have been moderated by the prestige and perceived high reputations of news outlets that have been established for generations (e.g., New York Times, BBC).

We shifted our focus and proposed a new system that allowed trusted users to set new standards for objective, high quality journalism based on a performance rating rubric we have created. The 6 criteria (shown in figure 2) represent up the core qualities of objective journalism and aim to provide a new set of standards for modern journalism. It is hoped that as a result of this system and the rise in quality and objectivity of modern journalism, spread of false information and fake news will be made less relevant.
